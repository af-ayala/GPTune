Crowd-tuning synthetic demo functions.

This crowd-tuning example tunes synthetic task functions using performance data
(collected for a different task value) from our crowd-tuning repository at
https://gptune.lbl.gov/repo/dashboard.

Note that, our crowd-tuning requires users to provide an API key. Users can
obtain an API key here (sign-up and log-in required)
https://gptune.lbl.gov/account/access-tokens

Users can run the prepared experiment as follows.

Step 1. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the tuning script

$ source CROWDTUNING_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 2. Run a prepared script that evaluates crowd-based tuning and
tuning without using our crowd-database.

(a) Mac
$ ./run_experiments_mac.sh

(b) Linux (our docker image)
$ ./run_experiments_linux.sh

Step 3. Generate plots to compare different tuning options.

$ python analyze_time_solution.py

Users can refer to these scripts run_experiments_mac/linux.sh and demo_tuning.py
to apply the crowd-tuning approach to users' tuning problems.
